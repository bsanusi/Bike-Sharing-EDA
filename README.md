# Bike Sharing Exploratory Data Analysis
Exploratory Data Analysis project, a part of Google Data Analytics Capstone Project.

## About the project

This project is a part of the Google Data Analytics certification capstone project. The dataset we are exploring is from a fictitious bike-share company based in Chicago, IL called Cyclistic. 

Cyclistic has a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system anytime. The bike-share company offers several pricing plans which include: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders. Customers who purchase annual membership are Cyclistic members. 

The purpose of this project is to identify trends from historical data understand how annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently.
